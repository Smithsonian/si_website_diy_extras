00:00:00.203 --> 00:00:03.036
(pleasant music)

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.430
<v ->Hi, my name is Tom Burns.</v>

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.910
I'm the curator of the Harvard Plate Stacks Collection.

4
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.660
The Harvard Plate Stacks is a historic collection

5
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.270
within the Center for Astrophysics.

6
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.570
It actually started back in the 1880s as a part

7
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.790
of the Harvard College Observatory,

8
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.900
and formed one of the largest data sets still to this day

9
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.480
of astronomical imagery

10
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.573
with over 600,000 glass plates.

11
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.300
With the invention of photography,

12
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.140
no longer did the same astronomer have to sit in front

13
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.110
of a telescope, put their eye against an eyepiece,

14
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.730
and look at the stars.

15
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.730
Instead, you could have a team of astronomer assistants

16
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.250
who could make plates - these photographic images.

17
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.790
Then you also needed another team to actually study

18
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.290
and to analyze all of the plates that were coming through,

19
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.620
and then to do these giant computational sets.

20
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.552
The fourth director of the Harvard College Observatory,

21
00:01:10.552 --> 00:01:15.552
Edward Pickering, realized that he had limited funds

22
00:01:15.565 --> 00:01:18.420
and the way that he leveraged the most out

23
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.100
of the money that he had.

24
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.360
He made it stretch farther by, yes, giving jobs

25
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.290
to women early in women getting roles in academia

26
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.990
and science, but particularly

27
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.210
because he could pay them less.

28
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.930
With the influx of women's colleges

29
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.220
and co-ed education, women were all coming

30
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.332
with amazing mathematics skills, scientific skills,

31
00:01:44.332 --> 00:01:47.280
and then particularly there was a large,

32
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.690
ever expanding, group of women with astronomy backgrounds.

33
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.600
And this is kind of how women started

34
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.600
to solidify their role here at the observatory

35
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.600
into something that was called both here,

36
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.870
and elsewhere at other observatories, "computers."

37
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.790
So in this first era of women computers here at Harvard,

38
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.800
the different questions that they were trying

39
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.203
to answer were very broad.

40
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.810
Stars are different sizes, and distance and size

41
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.870
will make it so you actually can't figure out

42
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.870
if a star is brighter to us because A, it's huge

43
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.643
or is it just really close and dim?

44
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.590
Also, for centuries and thousands of years,

45
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.810
people had looked up in the night sky

46
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.805
and noticed that some stars get very bright and then dim

47
00:02:41.805 --> 00:02:44.160
and change over time.

48
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.840
But understanding why stars were actually changing is right

49
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.330
where this collection starts.

50
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.370
And one of the most famous women,

51
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.335
who studied these changing stars was Henrietta Swan Leavitt,

52
00:02:58.335 --> 00:03:02.760
and her discoveries were all made in this particular region

53
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.010
of the night sky called the Small and Large

54
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.770
Magellanic Clouds that is only observable

55
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.150
in the Southern Hemisphere.

56
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.230
And utilizing parallax, scientists were able

57
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.880
to understand that these clouds were a distance away.

58
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.150
At the time, we didn't know that these are actually

59
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.420
what we call dwarf galaxies, kind of revolving

60
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.330
around the Milky Way.

61
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.020
And inside of these clouds, Leavitt is seeing

62
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.670
all of these variable stars.

63
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.320
She writes this paper,

64
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.320
where she tells the world about 1,770 variable stars.

65
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.960
This amount of variable stars quadruples the amount

66
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.952
of known variable stars, crazy amount to find in that day.

67
00:03:47.952 --> 00:03:50.760
And she starts to measure their tempo

68
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.720
or their period, the pulse of these stars.

69
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.522
And by doing that, you're seeing how much one

70
00:03:58.522 --> 00:04:01.770
of these variable stars gets bigger or smaller on the plate.

71
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.472
You're using an itty-bitty "fly spanker"

72
00:04:03.472 --> 00:04:05.490
and a magnifying glass.

73
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.100
And what the fly spanker does is it has those dots

74
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.180
that scale, and she's moving it over to see

75
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.830
how big or how small each star is.

76
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.070
By measuring not only the stars that are changing,

77
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.720
but the stars that aren't,

78
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.520
she is then able to figure out

79
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.273
how much the Cepheid variables are actually varying.

80
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.760
But what is that in reality?

81
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.030
You're measuring a fleck of pepper,

82
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.230
but you're measuring them

83
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.500
and you're calculating one point in time

84
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.650
to another point in time, putting them together in order

85
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.230
to create that sinusoidal function that creates

86
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.230
what we call now a light curve.

87
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.160
Leavitt was specifically studying these Cepheid variables.

88
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.940
So Cepheid variables have a perfect sinusoidal function

89
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.860
when you graph it out.

90
00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.330
Cepheid variables range around days to weeks.

91
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.570
So something like four days to three weeks

92
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.540
is when it gets bright, small, bright.

93
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.810
She's seeing this tempo not only in numbers,

94
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.260
but then she'll graph it out.

95
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.970
And once when she makes these graphs, she then starts

96
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.690
to realize if these stars, all the ones

97
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.790
that have the same tempo, all of those

98
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.850
in the Small Magellanic Cloud are the same size on a plate,

99
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.868
which means that they're the same brightness and that's new.

100
00:05:27.868 --> 00:05:31.560
So she starts realizing that there's this pattern

101
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.560
between this period or tempo of the stars with their size

102
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.090
or brightness, and that allows us to actually find

103
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.010
and measure the universe.

104
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.160
This becomes the Cepheid variable principle,

105
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.670
or more correctly, called the "Leavitt Law."

106
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.290
Leavitt gives us a ruler

107
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.663
to actually start measuring these distances.

108
00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.290
If I can find these stars in the Magellanic Cloud,

109
00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.080
but these stars exist everywhere in the universe.

110
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.810
They exist nearer to us.

111
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.990
That then allows us to find a Cepheid variable

112
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.320
that we can actually measure with parallax.

113
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.480
And that means that we can know the distance between

114
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.550
that Cepheid variable and the Earth

115
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:15.870
as long as you find any

116
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.290
of these Cepheid stars in the night sky.

117
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.750
Because we know the distance between Earth

118
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.640
and some of the closest ones,

119
00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.460
we can actually use the inverse square law

120
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.850
to figure out vast distances.

121
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.090
So she gives us the second rung

122
00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:34.920
of the cosmic distance ladder,

123
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.530
and with that second rung, every single one

124
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.140
that follows is building upon her.

125
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.140
And Leavitt was holding those pieces of glass

126
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.940
that they themselves are a record of not only our galaxy,

127
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:48.990
our solar system,

128
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.291
but the universe as we know it, across time.

129
00:06:52.291 --> 00:06:54.765
(pleasant music)
